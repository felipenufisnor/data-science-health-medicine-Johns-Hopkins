Data Science: Data Visualization for Health and Medicine

In this project I explored influenza epidemiological bulletins available on Kaggle.
I understood the incidence and mortality coefficients and visualized the evolution of coefficients and their convergence;
I joined databases from different sources to enrich my data;
I explored the limitations of available data sources, sought conclusions and comparisons to refine my views.
